# Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning in Python

## Lab Objective
This lab focuses on implementing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning for a specific tree in Python.

## Lab Description
Minimax is a decision rule used in decision theory and game theory to minimize the potential loss for a worst-case scenario. In this lab, the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning is implemented for a given tree. Alpha-Beta Pruning is a search algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm, making it more efficient.

## Lab Tasks

### Implement Minimax Algorithm
The first task involves implementing the Minimax algorithm for a specific tree and calculating the MinMax value of the given node. The time taken by the Minimax algorithm is also measured.

### Task 2: Implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
In this task, Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning is implemented for the same tree. The algorithm aims to find the optimal path with reduced evaluation of nodes.

## Output
Below are the outputs for each task.

### Output for Task 1 (Minimax Algorithm)
```
MinMax Value:  10
Time taken:  0.002345
```

### Output for Task 2 (Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning)
```
MinMax Value with Alpha-Beta Pruning:  10
Time taken:  0.001235
```
