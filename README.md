# Breadth First Search for Graph and Tree Traversal

## Lab Objective
This lab focuses on implementing the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph and tree traversals using Python.

## Lab Description
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next level of depth. This lab involves implementing BFS for both graphs and trees in Python.

## Lab Tasks

### Implement BFS for Graphs (Iteratively)
In this task, BFS is implemented for two example graphs (`graph1` and `graph2`). The BFS algorithm is applied using the previously implemented `Queue` class, and the starting nodes for the graphs are 'C' and '6', respectively.

### Implement BFS for Trees (Recursively)
For this task, BFS is implemented for two example trees (`root1` and `root2`). The BFS algorithm is applied using the previously implemented `Queue` class, and the starting nodes for the trees are '1' and 'Frankfurt', respectively.

## Output
Below are the expected outputs for each task.

### Output for Task 2 (Graphs)
```
# Output for Graph 1
['C', 'D', 'A', 'B', 'E']

# Output for Graph 2
[6, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1]
```

### Output for Task 3 (Trees)
```
# Output for Tree 1
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Output for Tree 2
['Frankfurt', 'Mannheim', 'Würzburg', 'Kassel', 'Karlsruhe', 'Nürnberg', 'Erfurt', 'München', 'Augsburg', 'Stuttgart']
```
