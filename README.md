# A* Algorithm for Graphs

## Lab Objective
This lab focuses on implementing the A* algorithm, an optimal greedy search algorithm, for graphs using Python.

## Lab Description
A* is a form of greedy-first search that provides an optimal path from the start node to the goal node by considering the cost of reaching the goal. In this lab, the A* algorithm is implemented for a specific graph using Python.

## Lab Tasks

### Implement A* Algorithm
In this task, the A* algorithm is implemented in Python for the specified graph. The graph represents a map with nodes and edges, and the A* algorithm aims to find the optimal path from a start node to a goal node.

## Output
Below is the expected output for the A* algorithm on the provided graph.

```
Path:  ['A', 'S', 'F', 'B', 'U', 'H', 'E']
Cost:  502
```

## Visualization
